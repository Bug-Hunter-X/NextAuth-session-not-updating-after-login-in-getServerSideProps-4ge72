# NextAuth session not updating after login in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using NextAuth.js with `getServerSideProps`.  After successfully logging in, the session in `getServerSideProps` doesn't reflect the updated authentication status, leading to unexpected behavior.

The problem stems from the fact that `getServerSideProps` runs on the server *before* the redirect from the login page completes. Therefore, it might fetch the session before the authentication is fully processed.

## Solution

This issue is typically solved by using `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` in conjunction with an additional check (a redirect, or loading mechanism).  The repository shows a robust solution that addresses this, and other similar scenarios.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
4. Attempt to login. Observe that the initial page load will not reflect the authenticated session. The solution demonstrates how to correctly obtain the session in `getServerSideProps` in this scenario.
